This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.1.

## Description

I have developed a comprehensive event booking application using Angular, NestJS, and MongoDB. The application enables users to browse and select various events of their interest and conveniently book tickets for those events. To facilitate secure and seamless transactions, I integrated the Stripe payment gateway.

The user experience begins with a user-friendly interface where users can explore a wide range of events. Each event listing provides essential details such as the event date, location, and basic ticket price. To enhance the user experience, I integrated the Mapbox API, allowing users to view the event's precise location on a map.

To cater to different preferences, I implemented a flexible ticketing system. Users have the option to choose from multiple ticket types, including standard and premium tickets. Each ticket type offers specific privileges and benefits, allowing users to customize their event experience according to their preferences.

One of the key features of the application is the ability for users to view their purchased tickets in the ordered section. This feature provides users with a convenient overview of their upcoming events and the tickets they have secured.

Furthermore, I designed a dedicated organizer section for event organizers. Organizers can create new events, manage event schedules, and add locations with the help of an interactive map feature. They have the freedom to define and customize multiple ticket types, each offering unique privileges to attendees. Additionally, organizers can easily edit event details, ensuring up-to-date and accurate event information is available to users.

Overall, my event booking application provides a seamless and intuitive user experience. Users can effortlessly explore, book, and manage event tickets, while organizers have a comprehensive set of tools to create and manage their events efficiently

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
